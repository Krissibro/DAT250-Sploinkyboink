\subsection{Descriptive Modeling}

Kotlin, developed by JetBrains (the Czech software company behind IntelliJ IDEA), is named after Kotlin Island in the Gulf of Finland, near St. Petersburg. JetBrains introduced Kotlin in 2011 as a modern language addressing limitations encountered with Java. The first stable release (Kotlin 1.0) arrived in 2016 and gained traction among Android developers quickly. In 2017, Google endorsed Kotlin as an official language for Android development, a significant boost in adoption. In 2020, JetBrains and Google launched the Kotlin Foundation, solidifying its role in JVM and Android development. Kotlin’s ongoing development focuses on multi-platform capabilities, broadening its use beyond JVM and Android to include web, iOS, and server applications. Kotlin is a statically typed language that compiles to Java bytecode, running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows compatibility with Java libraries and frameworks. Designed for safety, conciseness, and interoperability with Java, Kotlin is particularly valuable in three contexts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Android Development}: Kotlin’s concise syntax and enhanced safety features make it a preferred choice in Android development.
    \item \textbf{Server-Side Development}: Kotlin’s seamless integration with JVM-based frameworks like Spring Boot facilitates its use in server applications.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Platform Development}: Kotlin Multiplatform and Kotlin/Native enable shared codebases across platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop applications.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Kotlin is addressing some of Java's limitations. Kotlin as a programming language has many strengths:
\\
\textbf{Conciseness and Readability}: Kotlin’s streamlined syntax reduces repetitive code, improving readability and maintainability. This conciseness also minimizes potential sources of error and makes the codebase easier to work with.
\\
\textbf{Null Safety}: Kotlin’s type system helps prevent NullPointerExceptions by distinguishing between nullable and non-nullable types. This feature significantly reduces bugs related to null handling, a frequent issue in Java.
\\
\textbf{Asynchronous Programming with Coroutines}: Kotlin’s coroutines offer a simplified approach to asynchronous programming, enabling more efficient, non-blocking code execution ideal for network requests or tasks involving resource waits.
\\
\textbf{Interoperability with Java}: Kotlin’s full compatibility with Java allows teams to gradually integrate Kotlin into existing Java applications. This flexibility is advantageous for modernization efforts without requiring a complete code rewrite.
\\
\textbf{Multi-Platform Support}: Kotlin’s multiplatform capabilities allow for shared business logic across platforms, reducing code duplication and streamlining development for applications targeting Android, iOS, web, and server environments.
\\
\textbf{Functional Programming Features}: Kotlin includes extension functions, higher-order functions, and lambdas, allowing more expressive, modular code. These features support functional programming, further enhancing code flexibility and promoting cleaner architecture.
\\
\textbf{Data Classes}: Kotlin’s data classes simplify the creation of classes primarily used for holding data by automatically generating common methods like \texttt{equals()}, \texttt{hashCode()}, and \texttt{toString()}, streamlining data handling.


\subsection{Experiments: Is Kotlin bettter suited in developement than Java? }

In this section, we present a series of hypotheses regarding the potential benefits of using Kotlin over Java, along with experimental designs that could help validate or refute these assumptions. We are comparing Kotlin and Java code to see the differences between the languages. Some of the concepts discussed in the examples will also apply to our PollApp. 
\\
\\
\textbf{Hypothesis 1: Using Kotlin will provide better development speed and code conciseness than Java.} 
\\
\\
Kotlin’s syntax is designed to be more compact and expressive, which should reduce the time required to implement core functionalities such as user, poll, and vote management. To test this hypothesis, we can compare the time it takes to implement key features in both Kotlin and Java, while also measuring the number of lines of code required to achieve the same outcomes. We come up with a simple example for a class we call person, and compare the lines of code (LOC) to the same class implemented in Java. Our PollApp uses many classes, so a simple class structure is very beneficial:
\\
\\
\textbf{Experiment Example}:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=blue!80!black, colback=blue!5!white, coltitle=blue!50!black, title={-}]
    \begin{itemize}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
        \item \textbf{Kotlin} (Data class):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=kotlin]
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
        \end{lstlisting}
        
        \item \textbf{Java} (Full class):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=java]
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }

    public int getAge() { return age; }

    @Override public String toString() { 
        return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + '}'; 
    }
}
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent \textbf{Evaluation}: We see from the examples that Java are using significant more lines of code than Kotlin to achieve the same functionality. Kotlin uses only one line, while Java uses 17 lines of code when we include the empty lines in between. This is a significant difference. Kotlin's \texttt{data class} reduces the need for boilerplate code (like getters, setters, and \texttt{toString()}), making the code more concise and error-resistant. Java’s verbose approach introduces potential for mistakes and increases the overall code length.
\\
\\
\textbf{Conclusion}: Hypothesis 1 holds. 
\\
\\
\textbf{Hypothesis 2: Using Kotlin will result in fewer runtime exceptions related to null pointer errors compared to Java.} 
\\
\\ 
We will provide a small example that highlights why Java are more prone to null pointer errors than Kotlin. Null pointer errors can happen in situations where entities like users, polls, or votes do not exist even though they are expected to. These kinds of errors are common in Java, where null checks must be manually implemented. To evaluate this, we could introduce null values in critical parts of the business logic (e.g., missing users or votes) and compare the frequency of runtime exceptions between Kotlin and Java. By observing how each language handles missing data, we can assess Kotlin’s ability to enhance application stability. We will not test this in our project, but it is good to know that there are more ways to test the null safety of different programming languages.
\\
\\
\textbf{Experiment Example}:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=blue!80!black, colback=blue!5!white, coltitle=blue!50!black, title={-}]
    \begin{itemize}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
        \item \textbf{Kotlin} (Null safety):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=kotlin]
fun greet(name: String?) {
      println("Hello, ${name ?: "Guest"}!")
}
greet(null)  // Output: Hello, Guest!
        \end{lstlisting}
        
        \item \textbf{Java} (Manual null check):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=java]
public void greet(String name) {
        if (name == null) {
            name = "Guest";
        }
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
}
greet(null);  // Output: Hello, Guest!
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}


\noindent \textbf{Evaluation}: From the examples we see that Kotlin is designed so that it does not need to handle null checks manually. Kotlin’s \texttt{null} safety ensures that nullability is explicitly handled using \texttt{?} and \texttt{?:}, reducing runtime errors. Java’s manual null checks are error-prone and can be easily missed, leading to potential \texttt{NullPointerException} risks.
\\
\\
\textbf{Conclusion}: Hypothesis 2 holds.
\\
\\
\textbf{Hypothesis 3: Kotlin's coroutines offer a more efficient and readable approach to handling asynchronous tasks compared to Java.}
\\
\\ 
Also in this case we choose to have another code example to give evidence for why we think our hypothesis is true. Kotlin's coroutines are expected to improve response times and scalability when handling a high volume of voting requests.  If we would test the concurrency handling in a different way, we would implement the voting logic using Kotlin coroutines and then simulate high traffic scenarios. In that case we would be comparing the application’s performance with a similar Java implementation using traditional concurrency methods like threads. Key metrics such as response time and memory usage would be tracked to determine which language offers better scalability under load. We will not do this, but it is good to know that there are more ways to test concurrency handling.
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{Experiment Example}:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=blue!80!black, colback=blue!5!white, coltitle=blue!50!black, title={-}]
    \begin{itemize}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
        \item \textbf{Kotlin} (Null Coroutines):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=kotlin]
    import kotlinx.coroutines.*

    suspend fun fetchData() {
        delay(1000)
        println("Data fetched")
    }

    fun main() = runBlocking {
        launch { fetchData() }
    }
        \end{lstlisting}
        
        \item \textbf{Java} (Threads):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=java]
 public class Main {
        public static void fetchData() {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                System.out.println("Data fetched");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> fetchData());
            thread.start();
        }
 }
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent \textbf{Evaluation}: Kotlin coroutines simplify asynchronous code, making it more readable and reducing boilerplate code. Java’s thread-based approach requires more code and is harder to manage due to explicit thread handling and synchronization. We did not use this feature in our PollApp, but it could be very useful in other created apps.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Conclusion}: Hypothesis 3 holds.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 4: Kotlin's extension functions enable developers to write cleaner, more modular, and reusable code compared to Java.}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent To test this hypothesis, we compare how Kotlin and Java handle extending the functionality of an existing class, such as adding a method to capitalize the first letter of a string. Kotlin achieves this through extension functions, while Java requires either inheritance or a utility class.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Experiment Example:}  
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=blue!80!black, colback=blue!5!white, coltitle=blue!50!black, title={-}]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Kotlin} (Using Extension Functions):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=kotlin]
fun String.capitalizeFirstLetter(): String {
    return this.replaceFirstChar { it.uppercase() }
}

fun main() {
    val text = "kotlin is fun"
    println(text.capitalizeFirstLetter())  // Output: "Kotlin is fun"
}
        \end{lstlisting}
        
        \item \textbf{Java} (Using a Utility Class):
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=java]
public class StringUtils {
    public static String capitalizeFirstLetter(String input) {
        if (input == null || input.isEmpty()) return input;
        return input.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + input.substring(1);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "java is powerful";
        System.out.println(StringUtils.capitalizeFirstLetter(text));  // Output: "Java is powerful"
    }
}
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Evaluation:}  
The Kotlin approach allows the method to be called directly on the \texttt{String} object as if it were part of the class, improving readability and making the code feel more natural. In Java, a separate utility class is required, leading to a more cumbersome and less intuitive syntax. Additionally, Kotlin’s solution integrates seamlessly with the language’s functional programming features. Kotlin's extension functions make code more modular and intuitive by enabling developers to add functionality to existing classes without modifying them or creating external helper classes. This reduces boilerplate and enhances code reusability.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Conclusion:}  Hypothesis 4 holds. 

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Hypothesis 5: Kotlin has seamless interoperability with Java in addtition to better features.}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent In this case, we choose to provide a code example demonstrating Kotlin's ability to directly use Java libraries and classes without additional configuration. In the previous examples we have shown how Kotlin has better features than Java. Kotlin's interoperability allows developers to leverage the extensive Java ecosystem while benefiting from Kotlin's concise syntax and null safety features. If we were to test this hypothesis, we would compare the ease of using a popular Java library in both Java and Kotlin. Key metrics such as code readability, development speed, and error prevention would be analyzed. The Kotlin example in this case uses the java library to import Hash Map.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Experiment Example}:
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=blue!80!black, colback=blue!5!white, coltitle=blue!50!black, title={-}]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Kotlin}:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=kotlin]
    import java.util.HashMap

    fun main() {
        // Using Java's HashMap class in Kotlin
        val map = HashMap<String, Int>()
        map["Apples"] = 5
        map["Oranges"] = 3

        // Using null-safe operations
        println(map["Apples"] ?: "No apples found")
        println(map["Bananas"] ?: "No bananas found")
    }
        \end{lstlisting}

    \end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Evaluation}: The Kotlin example demonstrates how Java libraries can be used directly, with benefits like null-safe operations (\texttt{?:} operator) and concise syntax. Kotlin's integration with Java's mature ecosystem, supported by resources and community, enhances its practicality for real-world applications.  Kotlin’s interoperability with Java simplifies migration and allows developers to leverage the strengths of both languages effectively.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Conclusion}: Hypothesis 5 holds.
