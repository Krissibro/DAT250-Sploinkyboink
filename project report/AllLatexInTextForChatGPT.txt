# DAT250: Report for the software technology study project

Latex is a text processing system aimed at scientific writing.  

This repository contains starter LaTeX code that you can use for writing the project report. The example code should have must constructs that you will need to get write the report. Learning LaTeX will also be helpful for later writing you master's thesis report.

LaTeX is available for several platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). A good place to start is here: https://www.latex-project.org/get/

It is certainly possible to use LaTeX is more advanced ways compared to what is shown here. If you have suggestion for extension of the template contact Lars.

\section{Conclusions}

Concludes on the project, including the technology, its maturity,
learning curve, and quality of the documentation.

The references used throughput the report should constitute a well
chosen set of references, suitable for someone interesting in learning
about the technology.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
design.tex
-----------------------

\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}

Around 5 pages about functional aspects of the FeedApp application.

Concretely, you shall write about 

\begin{itemize}
	\item the \emph{use cases},
	\item the \emph{domain model}, and
	\item the \emph{architecture} (including applied technologies)
\end{itemize}

Each part shall ideally be accompanied with a graphical representation (diagram).

You may have a look at the \href{https://github.com/selabhvl/dat250public/blob/master/projectdescription/README.md}{Examples on GitHub}.

implementation.tex
-----------------------

\section{Prototype Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This section should provide brief details of how the prototype has been implemented.
You may want to use come code snippets here, but only focus on core features and aspects.
You are not meant to copy/paste your whole application code into the report.
Focus for instance how other developers may run your application and how they might develop it further...


The example below shows how you may include code. There are similar
styles for many other langages - in case you do not use Java in your
project. You can wrap the listing into a figure in case you need to
refer to it. How to create a figure was shown in Section~\ref{sec:technology}.

introduction.tex
-----------------------

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Approximately 1 page on:

\begin{itemize}

\item A brief introduction to the prototype implementation and topic of the project.

\item Discuss (briefly) the technology stack that has been selected

\item A brief account of the results that have been obtained in the project.

\item A one paragraph overview at the end, explaining how the rest of the report is / has been organised.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
This rest of this report is organised as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:design} gives an ....

\section{Technology Assessment}
\label{sec:technology}


Introduce in (sufficient) depth the key concepts and architecture of the chosen software technology. As part if this, you may consider using a running example to introduce the technology.

This part and other parts of the report probably needs to refer to
figures. Figure~\ref{fig:framework} from \cite{brown:96} just
illustrates how figure can be included in the report.

\begin{figure}[thb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figs/framework.png}
	\caption{Software technology evaluation framework.}
	\label{fig:framework}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Descriptive Modeling}

write where the technology comes from, its history, its context and what problem it solves.
Consider drawing a graph like in \cite{brown:96}.

\subsection{Experiment Design}

Write you hypotheses about what benefits the technology bring and how you can support or reject them via experiments.

\subsection{Experiment Evaluation}

Write about the results of your experiments, either via personal experience reports, quantitative benchmarks, a demostrator case study or a combination of multiple approaches.


For some reports you may have to include a table with experimental
results are other kinds of tables that for instance compares
technologies. Table~\ref{tab:results} gives an example of how to create a table.

\begin{table}[bth]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{llrrrrrr}
		Config & Property & States & Edges & Peak & E-Time & C-Time & T-Time
		\\ \hline \hline
		22-2 & A   &    7,944  &   22,419  &  6.6  \%  &  7 ms & 42.9\% &  485.7\% \\
